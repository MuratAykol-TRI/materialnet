MaterialNet
===========

MaterialNet is a visual exploration tool to explore large networks in the context of material science.


Requirements
------------
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

Setup
-----
1. Install the project dependencies:

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

2. Create sample data directory:

    ```
    mkdir public/sample-data
    ```
3. Unpackage sample data with your preferred tool. Example:

    ```
    tar -xf <SAMPLE_DATA>.tar.gz
    ```

    After this step, the `public/sample-data` directory should look something like this:

    ```
    stability.json
    cooccurrence-1k.json
    cooccurrence-500k.json
    structures/
    ```


Once these steps are completed, reloading the page in your browser should render the chosen sample dataset.



Interactions
------------

* Use the `mouse wheel` to zoom into the map
* Use `ctrl + mouse wheel` to change the node spacing factor
* `Clicking` on a node will select it, clicking on the same node again will deselect it
* `ctrl + click` on a node to select and pin it

### How to add a managed property to the mobx state?

Every property of the ApplicationState class (see ./src/store/index.js) annotated with the `@observable` annotation will be automatically tracked. This can be a primitive value, array or object.

In addition, the components itself has to observe the injected store using the `@observer` annotation.

Example component with proper store injection:

```js
import React from 'react';
import Store from '../../store';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';

// marks that the component should be rerendered as soon as an used observable property of the store has changed
@observer
class Template extends React.Component {
  // see https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html to inject the store into this component
  static contextType = Store;

  render() {
    // access the context as defined by the `contextType`
    const store = this.context;

    // just access or change the value
    return <div onClick={() => { store.year = 2005; }}>
      Hello {store.year}
    </div>;
  }
}

export default Template;
```

Besides regular properties, derived/computed properties are used. Just define a property with a getter function that uses other obserable properties. Annotate with `@computed` and mobx will cache and reevaluate the property when needed.


### What is autorun?

`autorun` is similar to registering an observer. The given function will be observed for changes and reevaluated when needed.

e.g.
```js
autorun(() => {
  console.log(store.year);
});
```

each time the `store.year` changes, a log statement will be created.
